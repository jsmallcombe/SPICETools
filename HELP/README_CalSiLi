Automated SiLi calibration 1.0

Program for automated calibration of SiLi detector with Bi207.

Run the following to generate a blank SiLi .cal file of the grsisort format

./bin/CalSiLi MAKEBLANK [blank.cal optional] 

The default output is called SPICE_blank_calfile.cal

If desired you can now parsedata with DDparser/SSparser to generate waveformshape info.
To combine this, run:

./bin/CalSiLi ADDWAVE [wave.txt] [blank.cal] 

Now sort some midas data. Run:

grsisort -laq --suppress_errors [blank.cal] [runfile.midas]

Then sort the resultant analysis trees to make the calibration. Run:

./bin/CalSiLi [blank.cal optional] [analysistree.root] [UseFitCharge optional]

The final calibration is saved to SiLiEnergyCalibrated.cal

To amend a calibration file run:

./bin/CalSiLi Fix [blank.cal optional] [analysistree.root] [UseFitCharge optional]
