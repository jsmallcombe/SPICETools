SPICE VISUAL PARSER VERSION 1.2

Usage dependent on grsisort classes (and subclasses)
TSiLi, TSiLiHit, TFragment
And on jgatingtool from personal Jlibrary.
Built using ROOT 6.04/12


Programs for scanning SPICE behaviour
DDparser is a program for sorting Fragment OR Analysis tree SPICE singles data for scanning SPICE behaviour 
SSparser is a viewer program (but can be used to sort and view, calling DDparser internally)

SSparser can be used to view externally sorted data, simply provide a root file containing 2D histogram of channelvs energy. If DDparser/SSparser is used to sort a fragment tree, waveform data is also stored for viewing.

Usage:
./SSparser analysis37434.root [Calibration.cal optional]
./DDparser analysis37434.root [Calibration.cal optional]

No wildcards may be used, use command line inputs to make use of variable substitution
e.g. ./SSparser $(echo analysis/analysis37434_*.root)

When sorting is taking a very long time (when using FitShape option for example) a single press of ctrl+c interrupt will safely end the sorting early and save the data.

Inputs:

Data file -
Any .root file containing "analysis" or "fragment" in the title.
Any Tree contained will be added to the TChain for processing

Output/vuew file -
Any .root file NOT containing "analysis" or "fragment" in the title.
A default output.root will be created if not provided.

Calibration file - Any .cal file e.g. Calibration.cal
Values will be loaded from the Tree if not provided

Sort Flags - The following flags may be parsed to change default sort behaviour:
UseFitCharge - All SiLi energies will be calculated from the waveform fit charge
FitShape - Do very slow shape fitting, results saved as histograms and written to WaveShapeParam.txt
MohRotate - Produce Mohamad's rotation histograms

View Flags
Path - Input is not from DDparser, ask for channelVenergy histogram location.
