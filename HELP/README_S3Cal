Automated S3 calibration 1.0

Very small program for automated calibration of S3 detector.

Run the following to generate a blank S3 .cal file of the grsisort format:

./bin/S3Cal MAKEBLANK [blank.cal optional] [Mnemonic_prefix optional]

The default output is called S3cal.cal
The default mnemonic is SPE02F (telescope)

Now sort some midas data. Run:

grsisort -laq --suppress-errors [blank.cal] [runfile.midas]

Then sort the resultant analysis trees to make the calibration. Run:

./bin/S3Cal [blank.cal optional] [analysistree.root] [histograms.root optional]

By default histograms are saved to S3energycal.root
The final calibration is saved to S3EnergyCalibrated.cal
