clx_mk_table.awk 
=================

Puts clx output in a nicer form.

e.g: ./clx <sample_30mg58ni_2.2.clx | ./clx_mk_table.awk 


./clx <a.clx | ./clx_mk_table.awk 



clx
====

Run as:  clx <input_file.clx

Output goes to stdout and CLXDCY.

THIS FILE CONTAINS THE INPUT DATASET. THE MEANING OF THE INPUT
CARDS IS AS FOLLOWS.
( FREE FORMAT IS USED UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED )

CARD #	  CONTENTS

  1	  TITLE ( MAX. 40 CHARACTERS )

  2	  I/O CONTROL ( FORMAT: 8I1 )
	  MEANING OF THE CONTROL BITS: 

          (NOTE WELL - OUCNTL, OUPSI, OUAMP, OUMEM, OUTENS, OUPN AND OUDCY ARE 
           ALL ARE HARDCODED INTO THE CURRENT CLX CODE AS 1)
           (ONLY OUPROW CAN BE CHANGED IN THE CURRENT INPUT FILE UNLESS CLX.F IS CHANGED)

	   #	MEANING
	   1	OUCNTL - Output control. Writes things like eccentricity of hyperbola,
                         distance of closest approach, range of integration, 
                         when integration step size changes, integration complete, largest
                         and final deviations and 1 clx 84 and 1 dcy 84.
	   2	OUPSI - Output control to print the dimensionless psi matrix for each 
                        multipole matrix element (E and M1 seperately).
	   3	OUAMP - Output control to print the final excitation amplitudes for each state
                        state and polarization (magnetic quantum number). The amplitudes have 
                        both real and imaginary amplitudes and a final population for that spin
                        and polarization is printed.
	   4	OUPROW - The output control to print the excitation probability after every time
                        integration step. However, the time is really replaced by the parameter, w.
	   5	OUMEM - Output control to pring the symmetrized matrix elements connecting the 
                        different nuclear states. 1 martix is show for each multipolarity and E or M.
	   6	OUTENS - The output control to print the angular distribution tensors in RHOB and RHOC.
                         RHOB are the statistical tensors in coordinate system B while RHOC is in
                         coordinate system C, where the beam axis is the z axis.
	   7	OUPN - output control to print out the level index, excitation probability, and
                       the differential Coulomb excitation cross section (in b/sr) for a particular
                       scattering angle in the CM system.
	   8	OUDCY - Create a file called CLXDCY and write some of the input and output parameters.
                        Also, for every angle, write RHOC for the decay calculations.

  3	  NMAX, NMPOL, [EMMAX (DEF:10.0)]
               NMAX - Maximum number of states of levels in the nucleus to
                      be studied. The largest value is 50 and the default is 2.
               NMPOL - Does not seem to be used by code any longer - no recommended value
               EMMAX - The absolute value of the largest magnetic quantum number considered.
                       It must be >= the total spin of the ground state level. Large values of
                       magnetic quantum numbers often becomes uninteresting in CoulEx. The 
                       default is 10.

  4	  [ACCUR (DEF:1.d-8)] [,XIMAX (DEF:6.0)] [,DIPOLE (DEF:0.005)]

               ACCUR - The limit imposed by the clx code on the precision 
                       of the final probabilities. If ACCUR = 0 then it is
                       revalued as 1E-8.
               XIMAX - The maximum allowed value of the parameter, XI, 
                       which is the symmetrized energy level parameter. 
                       This becomes the integration step along the hyperbola 
                       for the calculation. If XIMAX = 0 it is revalued to 6.
               DIPIOLE - the strength of the E1 polarization. If DIPOLE = 0 then it
                       is revalued at the default, which is 0.005.
                       E1-POLARIZATION ACCORDING TO "ALDER WINTHER, ELECTROMAGAGNETIC 
                       EXCITATION (APPENDIX J)"
  
  5	  ZP, AP
               ZP - Z of Projectile nucleus (swap with target Z for projectile excitation!)
               AP - A of Projectile nucleus

  6	  ZT, AT
               ZT - Z of Target nucleus (swap with projectile Z for projectile excitation!)
               AT - A of Target nucleus

  7	  EP ( MeV ) (laboratory projectile energy!)

  8	  THETA1 [,THETA2 [,DELTATH]] ( CM - SYSTEM )
               THETA1 - starting angle, in degrees, in the CM system, for CoulEx calculations
               THETA2 - stopping angle, in degrees, in the CM system, for the CoulEx calculations.
                        If THETA2 = 0 THEN THETA2=THETA1
               DELTATH - step angle, in degrees, by which to progress the CoulEx calculations 
                         between THETA1 and THETA2. If DELTATH =0 THEN DELTATH = THETA2-THETA1


  9	  N, SPIN(N), E(N) ( MeV), PARITY(N) (1=+,-1=-), K(N)
	  A CARD #9 IS REQUIRED FOR ALL STATES N=1,NMAX
            This card controls the input of the level scheme. N is the index number for the
            particular level. for example, thne ground state would have N=1 while the first
            excited state has N=2. The variable, SPIN(N), is the spin of the level defined by
            the index, N. This can be an integer, such as 2, or half-integers, such as 2.5. The
            ground state cannot have spin > 14/2. The energy of the state is written in units of
            MeV and the ground state must have energy = 0. Parity of the state is denoted with a 
            1 for + parity and a -1 for - parity. The K quantum number, if known, is also input.

 10	  N, M, ME(LAM,N,M), LAMDA (NEG. VALUE = MAGNETIC TRANSITION)
	  A CARD #10 IS REQUIRED FOR EACH MATRIXELEMENT. IT IS
	  SUFFICIENT TO USE ONLY THE MATRIXELEMENT ME(N->M).
	  THE CORRESPONDING MATRIXELEMENT ME(M->N) IS INCLUDED
	  BY THE PROGRAM. THE RPT PHASE CONVENTION IS USED ( SEE:
	  "ALDER WINTHER, ELECTROMAGNETIC EXCITATION" ).
             This card controls the input of the reduced electric multipole matrix elements for
             E transitions of multipole order 1,2,3 or 4. N is the index of the first level and
             M is the index of the second level connected by a matrix element. ME(LAM, N, M) is 
             the reduced matrix element connecting the two states of eb for E2 transitions, for
             example. This code only calculates CoulEx Magnetic transitions for M1. for this, 
             input a negative number OR LAMBDA = 5 for an M1 transition. This code only calculates
             E1, E2, E3, E4 and M1 transitions!
