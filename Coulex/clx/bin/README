clx_mk_table.awk 
=================

Puts clx output in a nicer form.

e.g: clx <sample_30mg58ni_2.2.clx | clx_mk_table.awk 




clx
====

Run as:  clx <input_file.clx

Output goes to stdout and CLXDCY.

MULTIPLE COULOMB EXCITATION PROGRAM  C L X

FORTRAN VERSION OF THE PL1 PROGRAM WALKUERE WRITTEN BY H. OWER (IKF).
TRANSLATED AND MODIFIED BY J. GERL.
slight changes by H. Scheit 8. Dec. 2003

INPUT TO THE PROGRAM: <stdin>

THIS FILE CONTAINS THE INPUT DATASET. THE MEANING OF THE INPUT
CARDS IS AS FOLLOWS.
( FREE FORMAT IS USED UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED )

CARD #	  CONTENTS

  1	  TITLE ( MAX. 40 CHARACTERS )

  2	  I/O CONTROL ( FORMAT: 8I1 )
	  MEANING OF THE CONTROL BITS:
	   #	MEANING
	   1	OUCNTL
	   2	OUPSI
	   3	OUAMP
	   4	OUPROW
	   5	OUMEM
	   6	OUTENS
	   7	OUPN
	   8	OUDCY

  3	  NMAX, NMPOL, [EMMAX (DEF:10.0)]

  4	  [ACCUR (DEF:1.d-8)] [,XIMAX (DEF:6.0)] [,DIPOLE (DEF:0.005)]
	  E1-POLARIZATION ACCORDING TO "ALDER WINTHER, ELECTROMAGNETIC
	  EXCITATION (APPENDIX J)"
  
  5	  ZP, AP

  6	  ZT, AT

  7	  EP ( MeV )

  8	  THETA1 [,THETA2 [,DELTATH]] ( CM - SYSTEM )

  9	  N, SPIN(N), E(N) ( MeV), PARITY(N) (1=+,-1=-), K(N)
	  A CARD #9 IS REQUIRED FOR ALL STATES N=1,NMAX

 10	  N, M, ME(LAM,N,M), LAMDA (NEG. VALUE = MAGNETIC TRANSITION)
	  A CARD #10 IS REQUIRED FOR EACH MATRIXELEMENT. IT IS
	  SUFFICIENT TO USE ONLY THE MATRIXELEMENT ME(N->M).
	  THE CORRESPONDING MATRIXELEMENT ME(M->N) IS INCLUDED
	  BY THE PROGRAM. THE RPT PHASE CONVENTION IS USED ( SEE:
	  "ALDER WINTHER, ELECTROMAGNETIC EXCITATION" ).
