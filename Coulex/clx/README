Write input files in the standard format as explained in README_CJBarton
Uses CM angle!!

Save input files in "input" folder

Run: bash clx.sh file.clx
This runs the clx code and parses the result through CJBarton's integrating script. Terminal outputs are saved in "output" folder file.clx.txt 

Run: bash pro_clx.sh file.clx
This ignores the input energy and angles of  file.clx and does many clx calculations over all angles and beam energy from 0.33-10MeV/u
If you see the following errors, dont worry, it doesnt have an effect:
"Error in <GSLError>: Error 18 in qags.c at 548 : cannot reach tolerance because of roundoff error"
Output Ex_....root file is saved in "Output folder" with name matching the experiment details.

A second scrip process the detector part for default labrange 15-50 deg
Run again user specified range
root -l -q "JTS/root_detector.cpp(massBeam,massTarget,Z1,Z2,DegreesLabFrom,DegreesLabTo,\"Ex_....root\")"

Alternatively the output "Ex_.....root" file can be processed with clx_process example of jaent
change the inputs at the top of example/clx_process.cpp then run:
make examples/clx_process.cpp 
./bin/clx_process

Finally to integrate your detector cross-section over the energy of the target run
root -l -q "JTS/root_target.cpp(massBeam,massTarget,Zbeam,Ztarg,mg/cm2,BeamMeV,\"Ex_....det.root\")"
Leave BeamMeV=0 to use max safe
latest root 6.08 having trouble with target

OR

To do a detector position calculation (i.e. Get rates for given E and target) runs
root -l -q "JTS/root_targetsuper.cpp(massBeam,massTarget,Zbeam,Ztarg,mg/cm2,BeamMeV,\"Ex_....root\")"
Leave BeamMeV=0 to use max safe

root -l -q "JTS/root_targetsuper.cpp(158,58,68,28,1.5,0,\"Ex_158Er_on_58Ni.root\")"
root -l -q "JTS/root_targetsuper.cpp(158,58,70,28,1.0,580,\"output/Ex_158Yb_on_58Ni.root\")"
